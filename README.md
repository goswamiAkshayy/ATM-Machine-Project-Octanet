# ATM Machine Simulation in Java

This project simulates an ATM machine with essential banking operations such as balance inquiry, deposit, withdrawal, PIN change, and viewing transaction history. It uses Javaâ€™s OOP features, such as classes and methods, and allows users to interact with the ATM through a command-line interface.

## Features
- **Balance Inquiry**: Displays the current account balance.
- **Cash Deposit**: Allows users to deposit money into their account.
- **Cash Withdrawal**: Allows users to withdraw money, ensuring sufficient balance.
- **PIN Change**: Allows users to change their PIN after verifying the current one.
- **Transaction History**: Displays the history of deposits, withdrawals, failed withdrawal attempts, and PIN changes.
- **Security**: The ATM allows up to 3 attempts to enter the correct PIN before locking the session.

## Code Breakdown

### 1. Class Declaration and Attributes
The `ATM` class contains the following attributes:
- `pin`: Stores the user's 4-digit PIN.
- `balance`: Keeps track of the account balance.
- `transactionHistory`: A list to store all transactions.
- `scanner`: A `Scanner` object to handle user input.

### 2. Constructor
The constructor `ATM(int pin, double initialBalance)` initializes the ATM with a PIN and an initial balance, and sets up the transaction history.

### 3. ATM Session (`start()` method)
This method initiates the ATM session and presents the user with a menu to choose operations. It keeps running until the user selects the option to exit.

### 4. PIN Verification (`enterPin()` method)
This method allows the user to input their PIN, with up to 3 attempts. If the correct PIN is entered, the user can proceed with ATM operations.

### 5. Operations
- **Balance Inquiry**: Displays the current balance to the user (`showBalance()` method).
- **Deposit Cash**: Adds a specified amount to the account balance and updates the transaction history (`depositCash()` method).
- **Withdraw Cash**: Withdraws a specified amount from the account balance if there are sufficient funds, and logs the transaction (`withdrawCash()` method).
- **Change PIN**: Allows the user to change their PIN after verifying the current PIN (`changePin()` method).
- **Transaction History**: Displays all past transactions (`viewTransactionHistory()` method).

### 6. PIN Verification (`verifyPIN()` method)
This method checks whether the entered PIN matches the stored PIN.

### 7. Main Method
The `main` method creates an `ATM` object with a sample initial PIN (1234) and balance ($1000), then starts the session.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Compile and run the `ATM.java` file in your preferred IDE or command line:
   ```bash
   javac ATM.java
   java ATM

## Example Output
```bash
Welcome to the ATM!
Enter 4-digit PIN: 
1234

1. Balance Inquiry
